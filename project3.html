                        <a href="https://soar365.org/" target="_blank"><u><i>SOAR365</i></u></a> is a non-profit organization with a mission to create life-fulfilling opportunities for individuals with disabilities. As their graphic design intern, I worked closely with the marketing and communications team to deliver assets and aid their senior designer in completing design&nbsp;projects.

                        <br>
                        I’ve created a diverse range of pieces for internal initiatives, community outreach, fundraising events, and more. Through this role, I furthered my understanding of best practices in accessible design, ensuring that all materials are inclusive and effective in&nbsp;communication.

                <h2 class="h2-title">Branded Flyer Templates</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                        At <i>SOAR365</i>, our small design team—comprised of my supervisor and me—faced an overwhelming volume of flyer design requests. To address this, I was tasked with creating branded flyer templates for internal communication. <b>These templates enabled non-designers within the company to quickly create and export flyers</b>, alleviating the pressure on our team while giving other departments more&nbsp;control.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The process required careful planning to ensure the templates were foolproof and accessible to all employees. Built in <b>Microsoft PowerPoint</b>, a tool available to most, the templates maintained brand consistency while maximizing usability. By implementing locked designs with fixed text boxes and styles, users can insert info at ease, without risking the disruption of design. This solution <b>significantly improved our workflow and streamlined internal communications across the&nbsp;company.</b>

                        The <i>Ladybug Fund Winetasting & Silent Auction</i> is an annual event hosted by <i>SOAR365</i> to raise funds for children with disabilities. As one of the organization’s largest fundraisers, it requires year-round preparation, including the creation of a wide range of design materials such as <b>invitations, digital ads, and event signage</b>. Through my work on this project, I was able to <b>sharpen my skills in branding and ensure cohesive, consistent design across all&nbsp;pieces.</b>
