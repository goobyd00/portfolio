                <b>I’m Gigi Pham-Ton</b> - a graphic designer dedicated to the balance of visuals and function.
                <br>
                <br>
                I graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts, where I received my <b>BFA in Graphic Design</b>, earned a certificate in <b>Computing Fundamentals</b>, and completed studies in <b>Product Innovation</b>. 

                <br>
                <br>
                I’ve had the opportunity to work with various clients and companies, some of which include non-profits, small businesses, and more. I believe that design is a versatile tool that can be used for diverse and inclusive causes. 

                With these experiences, I’ve been able to fine-tune my creative skills and processes.

                <br>
                <br>
                Outside of design, I still love to embrace my artistic side. Sketching, painting, and sculpting have always been major parts of my life that generate inspiration. 

                In my day-to-day routine, you can also find me caring for my plants and animals, trying out cultural recipes, or reconnecting with nostalgic video games.
