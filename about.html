                I’m Gigi Pham-Ton - a graphic designer dedicated to the balance of visuals and function. 

                I graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts, where I received my BFA in Graphic Design, earned a certificate in Computing Fundamentals, and completed studies in Product Innovation. 


                I’ve had the opportunity to work with various clients/companies, some of which include non-profits, small businesses, and more. I believe that design is a versatile tool that can be used for diverse and inclusive causes. 

                With these experiences, I’ve been able to fine-tune my creative skills and processes. My familiarity with marketing, print, UX/UI, web, and event design has allowed me to explore the numerous sides of what design can offer. 


                Outside of design, I still love to embrace my creative side. Sketching, painting, and sculpting have always been large parts of my life that generate inspiration. 

                In my day to day life, you can also find me caring for my animals, trying out cultural recipes, or reconnecting with nostalgic video games.
